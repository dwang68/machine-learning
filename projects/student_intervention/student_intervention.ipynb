    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one.

Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "**Answer: Based on experiments, I found that the SVM performed the best among the three classifiers I have chosen, and is potentially the best model for student_intervention problem. In terms of the attributes of the data, it is easy to see that there are a lot of features to consider, and SVM is a good estimator on higher dimension space with various kernel tricks as long as there are sufficient data. In terms of limited resources and cost, SVM is very memory efficient as it only cares about a few support vectors, and it typically trains faster than adaboost. It is also important to notice that the features in the dataset are not independent as we have converted categorical variables into multiple columns, and results in poorer performance for GaussianNBClassifier. In contrast, SVM is a measure of similarities maximizing the margins amongst classes that do not care about the independence of features. In terms of performance, SVM has the highest test score with 300 traning samples.  **"

    "**Answer: SVM is a popular algorithm for classification problem. The SVM takes data about previous students (age, gender, family, etc), and uses them to create a function that draws a boundary between the students who passed and those who didn't. The boundary should be drawn so as to maximize the difference between students who passed and who didn't while ensuring that majority of samples are correctly classified. Often, though, it's not easy to draw a decision boundary in low dimensions, so the SVM separates the passing and failing students by transforming the input space into a higher dimension feature space. Using this function created with students we already know passed or not, the SVM can look at new students' data and predict whether the student needs intervention based on the student's various features(age, gender, family, etc). SVM is very efficient for classification problem since it only cares about the samples that are closer to the decision boundary.**"

The untuned model has F1 score for training is 0.8664, and 0.8052  for testing. Compared to the untuned model, which uses rbf kernel with a C value of 1, the tuned model after using GridSearch method actually has a lower F1 score for testing. This is interesting because the best estimator given by grid_search has a lower f1 score on the testing set than another estimator deemed as not as good as the best estimator from grid_search."
